                3D printing is a kind of additive manufacturing that is accessible to home and hobbyist users.
                Machines which create 3D printed items out of spooled or resin plastics are available from retailers at affordable prices.
                I have found designing and creating objects using 3D printing to be a fulfilling and useful hobby.

                One helpful use of 3D printing is creating game custom pieces.
                While pieces for standard tabletop games are common and interchangeable, some games gain benefits from customized pieces.
                Tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons are an example of this, where artfully designed pieces aid in visuals and gameplay.
                This is a miniature I printed for a character in one such game.
                It stands roughly 1.3 inches tall and represents the finest level of detail achieveable with my FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) printer.
                Resin printers are much better suited to this sort of small and precise work.
                The model was not designed by me directly, instead it was made with Hero Forge and then the design was purchased for printing at home.
                Heroforge can be found online at their site <a href="https://www.heroforge.com/">www.heroforge.com</a>

                Printing can also be used to create items which are no longer commercially available.
                Years ago, a collectable game was around known as Pirates of the Spanish Main.
                These were plastic playing cards which were punched to allow assembly into sailing ships.
                This line was discontinued and no other game provides the same experience.
                Since the play pieces for this game can no longer be easily purchased, I decided to make homemade play pieces.
                Using Inkscape (<a href="https://inkscape.org/">inkscape.org</a>) and Blender (<a href="https://www.blender.org/">www.blender.org</a>) I created new cards for printing.
                These can be punched out and assembled just like the original cards.
                Challenges remain in getting the same decals for the ships, but stickers are usually used for this purpose.

                Printing can also be used to make functional devices.
                This is an enclosure I designed and printed as part of a school assignment.
                The assignment was to create a device that combined multiple sensor inputs.
                While not required, I decided to use Blender to create a case for my project.
                It contains cutouts for the sensors, wires, and the power LED.
                It also contains standoffs for the screws, which hosted metal threaded inserts.
                While Blender was used for this, FreeCAD (<a href="https://www.freecad.org/">www.freecad.org</a>) would also be a good tool for this.

                While many plastics are too weak to use for tools, 3D printing can still produce tools for niche purposes.
                In this case, I designed a tool to keep my hands away from the spinning wires while using power tools to create chainmail coils (<a href="chainmail.html">Check out my chainmail page!</a>)
                The first design wasn't strong enough, with the steel wire quickly wearing deep grooves into the path.
                To correct this issue, I used 3D printing just to create a chassis which holds grooved bearings and washers.
                The new design was much sturdier, however it has some alignment issues which cause the coils to bunch up.
                I think I know what went wrong and have plans to correct it, but have not yet returned to the project.

                3D printing is very versatile and can be used to enable projects that were not previously possible at home.
                At one point, I purchased a mask with a powered air filter that pushed fresh air directly into the mask.
                I bought this to use while sanding furniture for refinishing, but quickly realized I was much more comfortable in that mask than a traditional mask.
                The powered fresh air kept the mask from feeling stuffy or humid, plus the HEPA air filter provided additional protections that common masks did not.
                I decided then to design my own powered mask which could be worn to crowded events, like conventions.
                I mimicked the design of the powered filter box I bought, but instead of using a small hose I created a direct attachment for a more robust commercially available face mask.
                Then, I designed a facade for the boxes to make them look a bit better.
                In this case, I decided that pokeballs from the pokemon franchise were simple for the task and produced a fun look.
                I painted the facades and glued them to the back of the filters, facing the front of the mask.
                I wired the fans in the filters to a USB attachment, so I can power it with a typical portable phone battery.
                It's made crowded events smell a lot fresher!

                3D printing is getting more accessible to newcomers all the time.
                A reliable 3D printer can be purchased for only a few hundred dollars.
                As an example my printer is an Ender 3 from Creality, which is less than $200 as of this writing.
                It's a bit of an older model, and newer versions are avaiable with more features.
                FDM printing, where a spool of plastic wire is used as the input, is the most beginner friendly form of 3D printing.
                Resin printing allows much greater precision, but requires handling toxic liquid resin and venting dangerous fumes.
                FDM printing also requires a well ventilated area, but has less toxic options.
                The choice of plastic can also be confusing for a newcomer.
                PLA is generally a good starting choice.
                It's not very strong, but it's less toxic than other kinds of plastic when printing and it is biodegradable in specific conditions.
                3D printing plastics come in a variety of colors, but for multicolor objects it is usually best to prime and paint.

                Lots of tools are available for designing 3D printed items, such as Blender (<a href="https://www.blender.org/">www.blender.org</a>) and FreeCAD (<a href="https://www.freecad.org/">www.freecad.org</a>).
                In addition, lots of 3D printables are available on the web, like at Thingiverse (<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">www.thingiverse.com</a>), where I often go if I'm lookging for something fun to print.
                Once a design is ready to be printed, it must be prepared for the printer with a program called a slicer. I use Cura (<a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/">ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura</a>) for this purpose.
