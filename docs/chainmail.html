                Chainmail is a textile art which uses jump rings, often made out of metal, to make fabric, clothes, and accessories.
                There are a number of weaves, materials, and techniques that can be utilized to make unique creations.
                Other than rings, scales are often used to decorate pieces.
                For my work, I usually utilize steel, aluminum, and rubber rings, as well as aluminum scales.

                This is a chainmail turtleneck with an attached mantle and scale fringe.
                It showcases a number of chainmail materials and techniques in a single item.
                Primarily, it is made of a European 4-in-1 weave of half anodized aluminum and half rubber.
                The turtleneck material double-backs on itself to give the neck volume.
                The aluminum provides structure, while the rubber is stretchy and insulating, making the piece more comfortable.
                The rubber is colored white while the aluminum remains undyed, as white anodized aluminum is difficult to create and not available from my suppliers.
                The scales are also anodized aluminum, but they are dyed blue, green, gold, and red.
                I call it the "Harlequin" mantle as it will combine with a number of other pieces to create a harlequin themed costume.

                This is a chainmail choker, which is a piece of neck jewelery which closely conforms to the neck.
                It is constructed using a modified Japanese 12-in-1 weave.
                A variety of ring sizes, colors, and materials are used to create a centerpiece effect.
                The dark rings that comprise the back of the piece are rubber, allowing for some stretch.

                This is a simplified style of chainmail shirt, which uses a pair of simple European 4-in-1 panels on the front and back.
                The panels are connected with long small chains of European 4-in-1.
                A gather is used at the top of the panels to provide stability.

                This is another kind of mantle which lacks the turtleneck portion.
                It is a solid piece all the way around, and features a gather at the top of the neck.
                Plain anodized aluminum scales form the frill.

                This is primarily a scalemail piece, an over the shoulder pauldron.
                A tapering piece of scalemail consisting of two tones of scales is used.
                The scales are connected to a strap which wraps around the opposing shoulder to support the piece on the body.

            <p>
                This is another kind of chainmail shirt.
                Unlike a traditional chain shirt, it is made using a neckpiece which tapers out to combine into the front of the shirt.
                The shirt then continues to widen until it eventually meets in the back.
                It is constructed out of anodized aluminum woven using European 4-in-1.
                The rings for this piece use a slightly larger inner diameter than the other pieces listed in this gallery.
                This is done to speed the weaving process, as when larger rings are used less are required.

                To get started with chainmail, you need your own rings.
                You can either buy finished jump rings, or you can make your own!
                You can buy rings and supplies at a few different online stores:<br>
                <a href="https://theringlord.com/">The Ringlord</a><br>
                <a href="https://chainmailjoe.com/">Chainmail Joe</a><br>
                To make your own, start with some kind of metal wire.
                Wrap the wire around into a tight coil around a central core.
                Ideally, the core is a metal mandrel, and a drill can be used to speed the coiling process.
                For a beginner, the coil is made by hand any round rod can be used, even a pencil!
                The core is then removed from the coil, and the coil is clipped one ring at a time with wire cutters.
                For tougher wires, tougher cutting tools are required.

            </figure>
            <p>
                There are two kinds of cut for rings: hand cut and saw cut.
                Hand (or machine) cut rings end up with a rough point in the middle of the cut.
                This is a result of the material being squished together as the tool pushes through.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="segment">
            <figure class="inline">
                <img src="img/chainmail/tools4.jpg" alt="Saw cut ring" width="256" height="341">
                <figcaption>Saw cut ring</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The second kind of cut is saw cut.
                For this technique a saw is used to cut through the coil, similar to how a table saw cuts through wood.
                This results in smooth ends for the ring, which creates a finer final result.
                Saw cutting is difficult for beginners, and some kinds of metal should not be saw cut due to dangerous fumes.
                Unless you get specialized tools and experience, it's better to just buy saw cut rings.

            <p>
                When the coil is clipped, you are left with jump rings.
                Jump rings are the basic building block of chainmail, and are woven together using pliers.
                Rings start as neither open nor closed, just slightly misaligned.
                To open a ring, two pliers are used on either side of the ring.
                One plier is pushed away, and the other plier is pulled.
                The moves the jump ring in such a way that the ends slide past each other to open or close.

            </figure>
            <p>
                Once opened, rings can be woven together into a cloth and then closed.
                For a beginner, learning the European 4-in-1 is the first step.
                It is the most common weave and many tutorials can be found online.
                The result is a chainmail cloth which can be used in patterns to create chainmail clothes and accessories.
